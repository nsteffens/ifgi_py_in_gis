# 3D visualizations
These tools have been developed for the Python in GIS course taught at Ifgi.

## What is this?
The repository is splitted in two scripts: 
The show_dem.py script creates a "flying carpet" visualization of DEMs as .TIF images.
The time_space_cube.py script displays .GPX files as a space-time cube.

## How to run
import the scripts, call the function and pass the link to the file as a string.
